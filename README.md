# Bulk QR Code Generator
Multifunctional QR code generator that you can self host using Docker or just run it from a folder




## Docker
To use this setup, place the four files (Dockerfile, index.html, style.css, app.js) in the same folder. Then, use these two commands in your terminal:

1. Build the Image:
`docker build -t qr-image .`

2. Run the Container: (This maps the container's port 80 to your host machine's port 5555 (or change to your liking))
`docker run -d -p 5555:80 --name QR-Generator-Container qr-image`

You can then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5555 to see your QR website!


### To do ðŸ’¡
Still in development, but feel free to try it out.
Planned:
* download for each QR
* different download formats
* different graphics options
* logo in the middle

The initial code was from [TRMSC](https://github.com/TRMSC/bulk-qr-generator) tool.
